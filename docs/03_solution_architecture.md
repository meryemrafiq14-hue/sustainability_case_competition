# Solution Architecture

The proposed solution consists of a centralized sustainability dashboard supported by an AI-assisted collaboration hub.

## Core Components

### Sustainability Dashboard
- Visualizes research activity across the 17 UN Sustainable Development Goals
- Uses interactive elements to explore coverage, gaps, and trends
- Enables users to quickly assess institutional strengths

### Collaboration Hub
- Matches faculty and researchers based on compatibility
- Surfaces top collaboration recommendations
- Encourages interdisciplinary research formation

## Role of AI
AI is used to:
- Structure unorganized research metadata
- Support compatibility scoring and ranking
- Provide explainable, decision-oriented recommendations

The system emphasizes transparency and human-in-the-loop decision making.
