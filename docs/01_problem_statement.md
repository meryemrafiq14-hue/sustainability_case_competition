# Problem Statement

Universities generate a large volume of sustainability-related research, but this work is often fragmented across departments, disciplines, and individuals.

Key challenges include:
- Limited visibility into existing sustainability expertise
- Difficulty identifying collaborators with complementary skill sets
- Lack of structured insights into research coverage across UN SDGs
- Manual, time-intensive processes for finding research partners or gaps

As a result, opportunities for interdisciplinary collaboration and strategic sustainability initiatives are frequently missed.

This case focuses on designing a solution that improves transparency, discovery, and collaboration around sustainability expertise using data-driven and AI-assisted approaches.
