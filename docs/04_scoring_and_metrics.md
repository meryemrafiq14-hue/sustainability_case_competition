# Scoring Logic and Metrics

To support effective collaboration, a Collaboration Compatibility Score was designed based on stakeholder input.

## Scoring Components
- Topic Match (45%)
- Methodological Match (40%)
- Career Stage Alignment (15%)

These weights reflect the importance of shared research interests while encouraging complementary skill sets.

## Sustainability Metrics
- Research coverage by SDG
- Identification of under-researched goals
- Trends in sustainability-related publications and projects

The scoring framework enables consistent, explainable, and scalable collaboration recommendations.
