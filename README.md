# Sustainable AI Case Competition – Decision Support Prototype

## Overview
This project was developed as part of a **sustainability-focused case competition**, where the objective was to design a **practical, AI-enabled solution** that balances **environmental impact** with **business feasibility**.

Rather than building a heavy ML system, the focus was on **problem framing, decision intelligence, and stakeholder usability** — translating sustainability goals into **actionable insights** using an AI-powered prototype built in **Google AI Studio**.

## Business Problem
Organizations increasingly face pressure to adopt sustainable practices, but decision-makers struggle with:
- Translating sustainability goals into operational decisions
- Evaluating trade-offs between **cost, environmental impact, and scalability**
- Accessing decision-support tools that are intuitive and explainable

The case challenged teams to propose a solution that enables **data-informed sustainability decisions** without compromising business outcomes.

---

## Solution Summary
We designed an **AI-powered decision-support prototype** that:
- Guides users through sustainability-related decisions
- Incorporates business constraints (cost, feasibility, adoption)
- Provides structured, explainable recommendations
- Supports scenario-based evaluation rather than black-box outputs

The prototype was implemented using **Google AI Studio** to simulate real-world user interaction with an AI assistant.

## AI Prototype (Google AI Studio)
- Platform: **Google AI Studio**
- Type: Interactive AI assistant / workflow prototype

### What the Prototype Does
- Collects structured user inputs related to sustainability goals and business constraints
- Evaluates trade-offs across environmental and operational dimensions
- Produces clear recommendations with supporting reasoning

## Sustainability Impact
The solution emphasizes:
- Measurable sustainability considerations
- Transparency in trade-offs
- Decision accountability for business stakeholders

Rather than optimizing for a single metric (e.g., emissions only), the tool encourages **balanced decision-making** aligned with real-world constraints.

---

## My Role
- Structured the problem using a **business analytics lens**
- Defined sustainability KPIs and decision criteria
- Designed the AI interaction flow and reasoning logic
- Contributed to final recommendations and case presentation

---

## Key Skills Demonstrated
- Case structuring & problem solving  
- Sustainability analytics  
- AI product prototyping (no/low-code)  
- Business decision modeling  
- Stakeholder-focused communication  

---

## Limitations & Future Work
This prototype demonstrates concept feasibility rather than production deployment.

Potential future enhancements include:
- Integration with real operational and sustainability data
- Quantitative optimization models
- KPI dashboards for ongoing monitoring
- Validation using historical outcomes
