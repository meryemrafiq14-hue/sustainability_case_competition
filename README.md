## Problem Statement

Universities generate extensive sustainability-related research, but this work is often fragmented across departments, disciplines, and individuals, leading to:

- ❌ Limited visibility into existing sustainability expertise
- ❌ Difficulty identifying collaborators with complementary skill sets
- ❌ Lack of structured insights into research coverage across UN SDGs
- ❌ Manual, time-intensive processes for finding research partners or gaps

**Result**: Opportunities for interdisciplinary collaboration and strategic sustainability initiatives are frequently missed.

## Data Pipeline

The solution processes raw publication data through a multi-stage pipeline. The
demo data in this repo was generated using the logic below; the scripts are not
included in this public version.

```
Original CSV (filtered_publications.csv)
    ↓
[build_collab_hub_from_scratch.py]
    ↓
Researcher_Profiles_For_PowerBI.csv
    ↓
[generate_ccs_demo_data.py]
    ↓
data/CCS_Demo_Data.csv (for Power BI visualization)
```

### Data Transformations

1. **Researcher Profile Aggregation** (`build_collab_hub_from_scratch.py`)
   - Consolidates multiple publications per researcher
   - Identifies primary SDG focus (from top 1/2/3 SDG columns)
   - Infers research methods from keywords/abstracts
   - Calculates career stage from first publication year
   - Extracts top keywords by frequency

2. **Compatibility Score Generation** (`generate_ccs_demo_data.py`)
   - Creates simulated user searches with varied criteria
   - Matches researchers based on compatibility algorithm
   - Generates explainable recommendations
   - Calculates CCS scores for all matches

### Pipeline Scripts (not included)

The pipeline below reflects the logic used to generate the demo data. The
scripts are not included in this public repository.

For detailed data processing documentation, see [CCS_DEMO_DATA_EXPLANATION.md](docs/methodology/CCS_DEMO_DATA_EXPLANATION.md) and [SDG_MATCHING_EXPLANATION.md](docs/methodology/SDG_MATCHING_EXPLANATION.md).

## Collaboration Compatibility Score (CCS)

The CCS algorithm evaluates potential research collaborations using a weighted multi-factor model:

### Scoring Components

| Component | Weight | Range | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------|-------------|
| **Topic Match** | 45% | 70-95 | SDG alignment (exact match, related SDGs, or different clusters) |
| **Methodological Match** | 40% | 70-95 | Method complementarity (complementary methods score higher) |
| **Career Fit** | 15% | 70-92 | Career stage pairing (mentorship opportunities score higher) |

### Calculation Formula

```
CCS_Total = ROUND((Topic_Match × 0.45) + (Method_Match × 0.40) + (Career_Fit × 0.15))
```

### Scoring Logic

**Topic Match (Hierarchical Matching)**:
- **90-95**: Identical primary SDGs
- **85-89**: Primary SDG appears in other's SDG list
- **80-84**: Any SDG overlap between researchers
- **75-79**: Adjacent SDGs (e.g., 8 and 9)
- **72-76**: Same SDG category (Social, Economic, Environmental)
- **70-74**: Default (no match)

**Method Match**:
- **85-95**: Complementary methods (e.g., Theoretical + Empirical)
- **70-80**: Same or similar methods

**Career Fit**:
- **85-92**: Mentorship opportunities (Pre-Tenure + Post-Tenure/Senior)
- **75-82**: Peer collaboration (same stage, especially Post-Tenure)
- **70-80**: Other combinations

### Example Output

```
User: Dr. Smith (SDG 9, Computational, Post-Tenure)
Match: Dr. Jones (SDG 9, Empirical, Pre-Tenure)

Topic_Match: 93 (exact SDG match)
Method_Match: 91 (complementary methods)
Career_Fit: 87 (mentorship opportunity)
CCS_Total: 91

Explanation: "Expertise in Machine Learning and Data Analytics. 
Highly complementary methods (Computational + Empirical) create 
exceptional research synergy. Strong mentorship pairing: 
Post-Tenure and Pre-Tenure researchers."
```

For detailed scoring documentation, see [docs/04_scoring_and_metrics.md](docs/04_scoring_and_metrics.md) and [SDG_MATCHING_EXPLANATION.md](docs/methodology/SDG_MATCHING_EXPLANATION.md).

## Data & Methodology (Demo Transparency)

This repo includes **demo data** designed to illustrate how the collaboration scoring works.

**What's real**
- Researcher names and departments
- SDG labels aggregated from publication metadata
- Methods inferred from keywords/abstracts
- Career stage inferred from first publication year
- Top keywords for explanations

**What's simulated**
- Some user search inputs (SDG/method) are varied to show multiple scenarios
- All scores (Topic/Method/Career/CCS) are calculated by the algorithm
- Explanations are generated from keywords + scoring logic

**Important note:** The CCS score is **directional and explainable**, not a predictive model of collaboration success.

---

## Reproducibility (Pipeline)

Raw publication data → researcher profiles → CCS demo matches:

1. `build_collab_hub_from_scratch.py`  
   Input: publication CSV  
   Output: `Researcher_Profiles_For_PowerBI.csv`

2. `generate_ccs_demo_data.py`  
   Input: `Researcher_Profiles_For_PowerBI.csv`  
   Output: `data/CCS_Demo_Data.csv`

See `docs/methodology/CCS_DEMO_DATA_EXPLANATION.md` and
`docs/methodology/SDG_MATCHING_EXPLANATION.md` for the full logic used to
generate the demo data.
